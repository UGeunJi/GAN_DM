# Synthesis with GAN

```
** Multi-stream

one-to-one: Source's unique information
many-to-one: Source's shared information

Aggregate these informations

**feature concatenation**
```

## Many to One based on pix2pix

T1, T2, FLAIR(Fluid Attenuate Inverse Recover), PD-weighted ➔ One

healthy and glioma patients
